# EphSpace
by Phil Enock, Adrian Martinez, and Ashok Pillai, Spring 2005

## The project
EphSpace was created in Java as a final project for the Software Programming course taught by Barbara Lerner at Williams College in the Spring of 2005 by Phil Enock '05, Adrian Martinez '06, and Ashok Pillai '05, equal contributions.

## The game
The game was awesome. I'm sorry I don't have screenshots, and Java has fallen off in recent years, so there's no live demo up. Basically, you could fly around your spaceship, shoot AI-driven computer ships, get powerups to enhance yourself, and so on.

It uses a Model-View-Controller software design paradigm.

## Game controls were...
Left and right arrow keys to rotate, up and down for speed, and spacebar to shoot.
